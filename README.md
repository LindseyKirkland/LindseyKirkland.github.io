# Instructions for getting your web pages started.

A good reference for using GitHub is: [Let's Git started](https://happygitwithr.com/)

You will find chapters: 4, 12, 15 and 16 essential for getting started.


## Creating the Projects GitHub page.

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named “username.github.io”.  For me: “paulmbeaumont.github.io”
2. From top menu, choose: Setting -> Pages and set Branch: main /(root)
3. Click the green “Code” button and copy link.
4. Open a new “Project” in RStudio” with the same name as your repository. Put this folder some place where you would like to keep it long-term.
5. Download the “GitHubProjectPage” folder from the Canvas page and drag those files into your project folder. Note that the file extensions are: "index.md" etc. ".md" files are GitHub friendly and can be rendered in readable form on GitHub.
6. Commit and Push to make sure that your GitHub repository is updated.
7. Now you can edit your RStudio project files to personalize your GitHub page. Make sure to Commit and Push changes fairly often.

## Adding a new project to your GitHub Projects page.

1.	Create a repository on GitHub with an appropriate name.
2.	Link the repository to an RStudio Project.
3.	Edit files in your RStudio project and make sure to name your “main” file as “index.rmd”.
4.	Push & Commit your edits often.
5.	In your RStudio Projects page, edit the “projects.md” file to add the project links to your new project.
6.	Commit & Push
7.	Make sure that your new project shows up on your Projects web page and the links work.
